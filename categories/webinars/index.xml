In his talk, Jean-Pierre will show how the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) is a highly dynamic region between the open ocean and the inner ice pack. The ice over this region is subjected to waves, introducing new forces but also changing the ice from a cohesive material to a mobile collection of floes.</description></item><item><title>SASIP Webinar #4 - Tobias Finn - Nov 24th 3pm</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/webinar4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/webinar4/</guid><description>Our SASIP Webinar #4 with Tobias Finn on &amp;lsquo;Making the explicit link between Gaussian process regression and ensemble data assimilation&amp;rsquo; took place on Wednesday 24 November at 3pm CEST.
In his talk, Tobias showed how Gaussian process regression, also called Kriging, might help us to learn sub-grid-scale dynamics of sea ice. Starting with linear regressions, he explained in a stepwise manner the reasoning behind this type of machine learning. This reasoning will bring him to the approximation of Gaussian processes with random fourier features.</description></item><item><title>SASIP Webinar #3 - Polly Smith - Oct 27th 3pm</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/webinar3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/webinar3/</guid><description>Our SASIP Webinar #3 with Polly Smith on &amp;lsquo;Data Assimilation for State and Parameter Estimation&amp;rsquo; took place on Wednesday 27 October at 3pm CEST.
After briefly introducing herself and giving a summary of her research experience, Polly described how we can use data assimilation techniques to deliver improved estimates of uncertain, or poorly known, model parameters alongside the model state. She outlined the theory of joint state-parameter estimation and then discuss aspects related to practical implementation of the approach, using examples from some of her previous work.</description></item><item><title>Webinars will be back soon</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/coming_soon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/coming_soon/</guid><description>Polly will speak about data assimilation for parameter estimation, using data assimilation for joint state-parameter estimation, coupled atmosphere-ocean data assimilation.
Tobias will talk about combining data assimilation with machine learning and vice versa, borrowing ideas from ensemble data assimilation for machine learning.
Jean-Pierre will talk about breaking the ice: wave-ice interactions from averages to distinct events and vice-versa.</description></item><item><title>SASIP Webinar #2 - Christopher Horvat</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/webinar2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/webinar2/</guid><description>The recording of the presentation is available here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8YAugYNNKU and the presentation&amp;rsquo;s slides are available here : https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dnypn9byzdfn2g/SASIP-MIZ.pptx?dl=0</description></item><item><title>SASIP Webinar #1 - VÃ©ronique Dansereau</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/webinar1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/webinar1/</guid><description>The thin ice covering the polar oceans is a complex geomaterial that is constantly breaking and moving under the action of the winds and ocean currents. Doing so, it also experiences rheological transitions between a brittle solid and a granular fluid regime. A simple continuum mechanical framework was recently developed in the view of representing the dynamics of sea ice in regional and global stand-alone sea ice or coupled climate models.</description></item></channel></rss>
