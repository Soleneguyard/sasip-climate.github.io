To accomplish this we will improve the numerical efficiency of its underlying C++ code and perform exploratory work to enable continued improvements in model efficiency beyond those immediately necessary for integrating it into a climate model. WP1 is divided into five tasks, two of which address knownshortcomings of the current model version (tasks 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
