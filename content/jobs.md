SASIP: Scale Aware Sea Ice Project

Multiple positions are available as part of a new international project, SASIP. The overall goal of the project is to give a better understanding of the impact of amplified warming in polar regions. The project aims to develop a truly innovative, scale-aware continuum sea ice model for climate research; one that faithfully represents sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics and that is physically sound, data-adaptive, highly parallelized and computationally efÔ¨Åcient. The use of machine learning and data assimilation will allow exploiting large datasets obtained from both simulations and remote sensing.
