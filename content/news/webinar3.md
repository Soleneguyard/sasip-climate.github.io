Our next SASIP Webinar #3 with Polly Smith on 'Data Assimilation for State and Parameter Estimation' will be held next Wednesday 27 October at 3pm CEST!

After briefly introducing herself and giving a summary of her research experience, Polly will describe how we can use data assimilation techniques to deliver improved estimates of uncertain, or poorly known, model parameters alongside the model state. She will outline the theory of joint state-parameter estimation and then discuss aspects related to practical implementation of the approach, using examples from some of her previous work. She will finish by outlining the plans for her work within WP4 of SASIP.
