The 2023 SASIP  annual meeting took place in  Bergen  (27-30 June 2023).

Thank you to all the participants for these 4 days of inspiring science talks and discussions about sea ice!

This year we had about 60 participants of 7 countries (France, US, New Zeland, UK, Norway, Germany, Italy) from all the institutions of the SASIP consortium. 

Nice to see each other in person!
