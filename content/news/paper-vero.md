Veronique Dansereau et al. from WP2 publishes a SASIP-related paper.

[This paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64514-4_8)r discusses the numerical challenges pertaining to the treatment of advection in models that represent both the extreme gradients associated with brittle fracturing and the large, permanent post-fracture deformations in complex geomaterials. When developing the Maxwell-Elasto-Brittle rheological model for sea ice, we chose to go Eulerian and to make use of the Discontinuous Galerkin methods. Their implementation and first results are presented here. This work will be pursued within SASIP, Work Package 1.
