This month we publish a video from work in progress in SASIP-WP2, provided by Jean-Pierre Auclair @ISTERRE, Grenoble.

_Fig.: Movie produced by JP. Auclair @ ISTERRE, Grenoble. It illustrates work in progress in SASIP-WP2 with a 1D simulations of spectral waves entering and fracturing a continuous sea ice cover of 70cm. Fractures occur when the elastic energy of flexion from the ice deformation exceeds the energy required to break the material._
