The 2022 SASIP  annual meeting took place in Grenoble  (20-23 June 2022).

Thank you to all the participants for these 3 days of inspiring science talks and discussions about sea ice modeling!

This event was the first in-person meeting of the project, and it has gathered 55 participants of 7 countries (France, US, New Zeland, UK, Norway, Germany, Canada) from the 13 institutions of the SASIP consortium.

We will soon post here the recordings of the science talks and discussions. Keep posted!
