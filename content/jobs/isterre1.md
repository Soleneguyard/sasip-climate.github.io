18-month post-doctoral researcher position in Grenoble, France on modelling mechanical interactions between waves and sea ice. 

Within SASIP project, the successful candidate will focus particularly on (i) implementing new parameterizations in an existing large-scale coupled sea ice-ocean model, NeXtSIM, with the help of a research engineer (ii) validating the new parameterizations on the basis of comparisons with observations of ice deformation and drift (iii) adjusting, if necessary, the mechanical parameterizations according to the results of these comparisons and in the view of the specific needs of regional and global scales sea ice models.

The researcher/post-doctoral fellow will a work in a group specialized in the mechanics of continuous media and of sea ice in particular, including engineers, PhD students and postdoctoral fellows.
