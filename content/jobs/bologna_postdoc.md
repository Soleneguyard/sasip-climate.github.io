1 Postdoc (3 years) in the context of the international project SASIP that studies the Arctic changes. 

The postdoc will work at the Dept. of Physics of University of Bologna, in close collaboration with our partner at CMCC, to develop a data assimilation scheme for the advanced sea-ice model neXtSIM, both in stand-alone and in its coupled-to-ocean version. 

The postdoc will have the chance to be part of a truly multinational research effort and to be in contact (by visiting the project's partners) with collaborators across EU and USA. 

The postdoc will work on the development and implementation of ensemble data assimilation for the Arctic sea-ice.
