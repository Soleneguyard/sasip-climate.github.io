1-year Postdoc opportunity at the University of Bologna to work on machine learning and data assimilation.
The project aims at studying the mechanisms leading to atmospheric convection.
Previous experience in data assimilation and machine learning are desirable but not mandatory and background in atmospheric convention and/or dynamical systems is also advantageous.

The project lasts for 1 year but, based on performances, extension for up to two additional years are possible within the same research team.
    
The team undergoes research on topics from dynamical systems to data assimilation and machine learning with applications in climate science at large, including Arctic sea-ice, atmospheric convection as well as weather and climate prediction.

More information and the application link can be found [here](https://bandi.unibo.it/ricerca/assegni-ricerca?id_bando=65714).
Deadline: 30 April 2023
Start date: Before July 2023
