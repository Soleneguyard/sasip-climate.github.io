3-years researcher or post-doctoral researcher position in Grenoble, France on processes and modelling of the sea ice/ocean/atmosphere system. 

Within SASIP project, the successful candidate will focus particularly on the sea ice dynamics simulated by the new neXtSIM-DG model, comparing it to both observations and other existing sea ice models (e.g. SI3 or neXtSIM in its Lagrangian version). In particular, the researcher will evaluate the realism of this dynamics including a new sub-mesh physics parameterization that takes into account ice floe dynamics (developed within SASIP by another team based in Grenoble), and will try to characterize its impact on oceanic or atmospheric boundary layers.

The researcher/post-doctoral fellow will work in the Multi-scalE Ocean Modeling (MEOM, http://meom-group.github.io) research group of the Institute of Environmental Geosciences (IGE) in the framework of the SASIP project and under the supervision of Pierre Rampal. He/she will work closely with Dr VÃ©ronique Dansereau (ISTERRE) and Dr Einar Olason (NERSC, Bergen/Norway).
