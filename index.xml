To accomplish this we will improve the numerical efficiency of its underlying C++ code and perform exploratory work to enable continued improvements in model efficiency beyond those immediately necessary for integrating it into a climate model.
WP1 is divided into five tasks, two of which address known shortcomings of the current model version, two which aim to push the numerical performanc eof the model further and one concerned with evaluating the physical consistency of the results obtained with the updated model code.</description></item><item><title>Amélie Bataille</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/team/amelie-bataille/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 10:47:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/team/amelie-bataille/</guid><description>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France

When developing the Maxwell-Elasto-Brittle rheological model for sea ice, we chose to go Eulerian and to make use of the Discontinuous Galerkin methods. Their implementation and first results are presented here. This work will be pursued within SASIP, Work Package 1.</description></item><item><title>WP2 Sea Ice Rheology — Physical Parameterizations</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/research/work-package-two/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/research/work-package-two/</guid><description>We are concerned with enhancing the mechanical parametrizations of the rheological framework employed in the continuum sea ice model developed within SASIP.
The aim is to develop physically sound parametrizations that can translate the dependence of the mechanical strength of the ice cover at the large scale (10-100 km) on both its granular concentration and level of fracturing at the small scale (&amp;lt; 10 km), thereby enabling the rheological framework to represent adequately the spatial and temporal mechanical transition between a dense, brittle ice pack and a loose, granular aggregate of ice floes reminiscent of the Marginal Ice Zone.</description></item><item><title>Einar Ólason</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/team/einar-olason/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 10:47:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/team/einar-olason/</guid><description>Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, Norway

The presentation entitled A continuum viscous-elastic-brittle, FEM/DG model for the fracture and drift of sea ice will be made by Véronique Dansereau.
Here is the abstract for further information:
The thin ice covering the polar oceans is a complex geomaterial that is constantly breaking and moving under the action of the winds and ocean currents.</description></item><item><title>WP3 Ice–Ocean Interactions</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/research/work-package-three/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/research/work-package-three/</guid><description>Across a single sea ice floe just a few meters wide, upper ocean exchanges of heat, momentum, and freshwater can vary by two orders of magnitude. Ocean surface waves flex and fragment sea ice altering its geometry, driving ocean mixing and sea ice melting. These effects, and their important impact on sea ice and ocean variability, are forced by variations in sea ice geometry much smaller than a continuum climate model grid scale.</description></item><item><title>Véronique Dansereau</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/team/veronique-dansereau/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 10:47:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/team/veronique-dansereau/</guid><description>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France

To meet this goal we shall develop specific and novel data assimilation (DA) methods adapted to the new continuum version of the sea ice model neXtSIM discretised using discontinuous Galerkin method. WP4 will also use state-of-the art DA and machine learning (ML) methods not used in sea ice modeling before, and develop novel approaches for the unique computational and physical features of neXtSIM.</description></item><item><title>Chris Horvat</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/team/chris-horvat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 10:47:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/team/chris-horvat/</guid><description>Brown University, United States

Hence, we expect that a more accurate representation of sea ice dynamics would lead to a better climate mean state and variability in sea-ice covered areas. Whether this matters for representing the climate response to increased CO2 in polar regions and beyond remains an open question.</description></item><item><title>Alberto Carrassi</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/team/alberto-carrassi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 10:47:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/team/alberto-carrassi/</guid><description>University of Reading, United Kingdom
